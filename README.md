# unslider
Working on an old site that used `idiot/unslider` which now doesn't exist, pulled the version of code I had and placed here with a `bower.json` file so that the package can be installed using the project bower file below:

```
// project bower.json file
{
  "name": "site-name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "jquery": "~2.1.1",
    "unslider": "git@github.com:jamesfairhurst/unslider.git#^1.0.0"
  }
}
```
